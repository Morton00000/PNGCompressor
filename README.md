# PNGCompressor
This was created to replecate the filesizes of the Unstitcher I had made.

This required my to compile this in Java 8 but there is a pre comiled .jar.

Just stick the jar in a folder with the images you want to use and it will created a new folder "compressed_images" with any images that are smaller than the originals.
